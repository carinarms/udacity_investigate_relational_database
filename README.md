In this project, SQL was used to explore a database related to movie rentals. SQL code was written to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of this project submission, I ran SQL queries and built visualizations to showcase the output of my queries.

The project submission is a presentation, which was reviewed, and for which certains expectations needed to be met to pass. For the presentation component, four slides had to be created, each slide containing:

- a question of interest;
- a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question;
- a supporting visualization created using the final data of the SQL query that answers the question of interest.

The final project submission includes:

- a set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide;
- a text file with the queries needed to answer each of the four questions.
